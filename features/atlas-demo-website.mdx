Atlas is a fully functional demo application by Dodo Payments that showcases an AI art generation platform. It demonstrates all three billing models—**usage-based billing**, **one-time payments**, and **subscriptions**—with integrated checkout flows.

<Info>
**Live Demo**: Visit [atlas.dodopayments.com](https://atlas.dodopayments.com/) to explore the platform and test all billing flows.
</Info>

## Overview

Atlas simulates a real-world AI art generation platform where users create images from text prompts. The demo highlights three distinct purchase flows, each demonstrating different billing models and checkout experiences:

- **Usage-Based Billing**: Pay per image generated ($0.75 per image)
- **Subscription**: Unlimited Pro plan ($20/month)
- **One-Time Purchase**: Credit packs ($7 for 10 credits)

After completing any purchase, users are redirected to the **Atlas Studio dashboard** where they can generate artwork and track their usage in real-time.
