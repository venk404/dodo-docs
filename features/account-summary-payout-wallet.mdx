## Wallet Structure

Each business account maintains **four native wallets** based on supported payout currencies:

| Wallet | Currency Code |
| --- | --- |
| USD Wallet | USD |
| GBP Wallet | GBP |
| EUR Wallet | EUR |
| INR Wallet | INR |

### Wallet Logic

- Merchant sales are **credited to the appropriate wallet** based on the **customer's payment currency** and **geographic location**.
- This system optimizes for **payment processor efficiency**, **reduced transaction fees** and **lower currency conversion charges**.

## Balance Ledger

Each wallet has an **independent ledger** recording all related financial activity - payments, refunds, fees, and payouts - in that specific wallet's currency.

A **Consolidated Ledger** combines all wallet data, offering a unified view of the merchant's entire financial history.

### Filters and Navigation

- **Currency Filter:** Allows merchants to view transactions by specific wallet (USD, INR, GBP, EUR).
- **All Transactions View:** Provides an aggregated view across all wallets with unified sorting, filtering, and search capabilities.

### Transaction Types

The following transaction types are recorded in the Balance ledger:

| Transaction Type | Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Payment** | Credit (+) | Successful customer payment |
| **Refund** | Debit (-) | Returned amount to the customer |
| **Transaction Fees** | Debit (-) | Processing fees applied to payments |
| **Refund Fees** | Debit (-) | Fees deducted for processing refunds |
| **Sales Tax** | Debit (-) | Tax amount charged on payments |
| **Sales Tax Refund** | Credit (+) | Refunded portion of sales tax on refunds |
| **Payout** | Debit (-) | Amount transferred to the merchant's bank account |
| **Payout Fees** | Debit (-) | Transaction fees deducted from payouts |

#### Additional Fields

- **Transaction Amount:** Total value associated with the transaction.
- **Transaction Timestamp:** Date and time of transaction completion.
- **Transaction ID:** Unique identifier for tracking and support purposes.

## Total Balance

The **Total Balance** section shows a **consolidated indicative amount** of all wallet balances - **USD, GBP, and EUR** - after conversion to USD.

<Note>
**Indicative Display:** The displayed amount is **for reference only**. Final payout amounts may vary based on the actual exchange rate at the time of transfer.
</Note>

## Conclusion

The **Balances** aims to deliver **transparency, accuracy, and flexibility** in managing multi-currency funds.

By maintaining separate native wallets, providing currency-based filters, and enabling indicative consolidated views, Dodo Payments ensures merchants always have a clear understanding of their earnings and payout readiness.
