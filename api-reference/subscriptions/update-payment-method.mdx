title: Update Payment Method
description: Update the payment method for an existing subscription. You can either add a new payment method or use an existing one from the customer's saved payment methods.
---

Update the payment method for a subscription. This endpoint supports both active subscriptions and subscriptions in `on_hold` state.

<Info>
For subscriptions in `on_hold` state, updating the payment method automatically creates a charge for remaining dues, generates an invoice, and reactivates the subscription to `active` state upon successful payment.
</Info>

### Use Cases

- **Active subscriptions**: Update payment method when a card expires or customer wants to use a different payment method
- **On hold subscriptions**: Reactivate subscriptions that went on hold due to failed payments by updating the payment method
- **Payment method management**: Switch between saved payment methods or add new ones

<Info>
To list existing payment methods for a customer, use the [List Payment Methods API](/api-reference/customers/get-customer-payment-methods). This helps you retrieve available payment method IDs when using `type: "existing"` to update a subscription's payment method.
</Info>

### Behavior for Active Subscriptions

When updating the payment method for an active subscription:

- The payment method is updated immediately
- No charge is created
- The subscription remains active
- Future renewals will use the new payment method

### Behavior for On Hold Subscriptions

When updating the payment method for a subscription in `on_hold` state:

1. A charge is automatically created for remaining dues
2. An invoice is generated for the charge
3. The payment is processed using the new payment method
4. Upon successful payment, the subscription is reactivated to `active` state
5. You'll receive webhook events: `payment.succeeded` followed by `subscription.active`

<Warning>
If the payment fails after updating the payment method for an `on_hold` subscription, the subscription will remain in `on_hold` state. Monitor webhook events to track payment status.
</Warning>

### Webhook Events

When updating a payment method for an `on_hold` subscription, you'll receive the following webhook events:

1. **`payment.succeeded`** - The charge for remaining dues was successful
2. **`subscription.active`** - The subscription has been reactivated
