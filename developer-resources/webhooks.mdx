## Getting Started

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Webhook Settings">
    Navigate to the DodoPayments Dashboard and go to `Settings > Webhooks`.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Webhook Endpoint">
    Click on `Add Webhook` to create a new webhook endpoint.
    

    <Frame>
        <img src="/images/webhooks/create-endpoint.png" alt="Add Webhook" />
    </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Endpoint URL">
    Enter the URL where you want to receive webhook events.
    
</Step>

<Step title="Select Events to Receive">
    Choose the specific events your webhook endpoint should listen for by selecting them from the event list.
    
    <Tip>
    Only selected events will trigger webhooks to your endpoint, helping you avoid unnecessary traffic and processing.
    </Tip>
</Step>


<Step title="Get Secret Key">
    Obtain your webhook `Secret Key` from the settings page. You'll use this to verify the authenticity of received webhooks.
    
    <Warning>
    Keep your webhook secret key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Rotate Secret (Optional)">
    If needed, you can rotate your webhook secret for enhanced security. Click the **Rotate Secret** button in your webhook settings.
    
    <Warning>
    Rotating the secret will **expire it** and **replace it** with a new one. The old secret will only be valid for the next 24 hours. Afterward, trying to verify with the old secret will fail.
    </Warning>
    
    <Info>
    Use secret rotation periodically or immediately if you suspect your current secret has been compromised.
    </Info>
</Step>
</Steps>


## Configuring Subscribed Events

You can configure which specific events they want to receive for each webhook endpoint.

### Accessing Event Configuration

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Webhook Details">
    Go to your Dodo Payments Dashboard and navigate to `Settings > Webhooks`.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Endpoint">
    Click on the webhook endpoint you want to configure.
</Step>

<Step title="Open Event Settings">
    In the webhook details page, you'll see a "Subscribed events" section. Click the **Edit** button to modify your event subscriptions.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Event Subscriptions

<Steps>
<Step title="View Available Events">
    The interface displays all available webhook events organized in a hierarchical structure. Events are grouped by category (e.g., `dispute`, `payment`, `subscription`).
</Step>

<Step title="Search and Filter">
    Use the search bar to quickly find specific events by typing event names or keywords.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Events">
    Check the boxes next to the events you want to receive. You can:
    - Select individual sub-events (e.g., `dispute.accepted`, `dispute.challenged`)
    - Select parent events to receive all related sub-events
    - Mix and match specific events based on your needs
</Step>

<Step title="Review Event Details">
    Hover over the information icon (ⓘ) next to each event to see a description of when that event is triggered.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click **Save** to apply your changes, or **Cancel** to discard modifications.
</Step>
</Steps>


<Warning>
If you deselect all events, your webhook endpoint will not receive any notifications. Make sure to select at least the events your application needs to function properly.
</Warning>

## Webhook Delivery

### Timeouts

Webhooks have a **15-second timeout window** for both connection and read operations. Ensure your endpoint responds quickly to avoid timeouts.

<Tip>
Process webhooks asynchronously by acknowledging receipt immediately with a `200` status code, then handling the actual processing in the background.
</Tip>

### Automatic Retries

If a webhook delivery fails, Dodo Payments automatically retries with exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming your system.

| Attempt | Delay | Description |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Immediately | First retry happens right away |
| 2 | 5 seconds | Second attempt after short delay |
| 3 | 5 minutes | Third attempt with increased backoff |
| 4 | 30 minutes | Fourth attempt continuing backoff |
| 5 | 2 hours | Fifth attempt with extended delay |
| 6 | 5 hours | Sixth attempt with longer delay |
| 7 | 10 hours | Seventh attempt with maximum delay |
| 8 | 10 hours | **Final attempt** - webhook marked as failed if unsuccessful |

<Info>
**Maximum of 8 retry attempts** per webhook event. For example, if a webhook fails three times before succeeding, the total delivery time is approximately 35 minutes and 5 seconds from the first attempt.
</Info>

<Tip>
Use the Dodo Payments dashboard to manually retry individual messages or bulk recover all failed messages at any time.
</Tip>

### Idempotency

Each webhook event includes a unique `webhook-id` header. Use this identifier to implement idempotency and prevent duplicate processing.

```javascript
// Example: Storing webhook IDs to prevent duplicate processing
const processedWebhooks = new Set();

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const webhookId = req.headers['webhook-id'];
  
  if (processedWebhooks.has(webhookId)) {
    return res.status(200).json({ received: true });
  }
  
  processedWebhooks.add(webhookId);
  // Process the webhook...
});
```

<Warning>
Always implement idempotency checks. Due to retries, you may receive the same event multiple times.
</Warning>

### Event Ordering

Webhook events may arrive out of order due to retries or network conditions. Design your system to handle events in any sequence.

<Info>
You will receive the **latest payload at the time of delivery**, regardless of when the webhook event was originally emitted.
</Info>

## Securing Webhooks

To ensure the security of your webhooks, always validate the payloads and use HTTPS.

### Verifying Signatures

Each webhook request includes a `webhook-signature` header, an HMAC SHA256 signature of the webhook payload and timestamp, signed with your secret key.

#### SDK verification (recommended)

All official SDKs include built‑in helpers to securely validate and parse incoming webhooks. Two methods are available:

* `unwrap()`: Verifies signatures using your webhook secret key
* `unsafe_unwrap()`: Parses payloads without verification

<Tip>
  Provide your webhook secret via `DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` when initializing the Dodo Payments client.
</Tip>

#### Manual verification (alternative)

If you are not using an SDK, you can verify signatures yourself following the Standard Webhooks spec:

1. Build the signed message by concatenating `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, and the exact raw stringified `payload`, separated by periods (`.`).
2. Compute the HMAC SHA256 of that string using your webhook secret key from the Dashboard.
3. Compare the computed signature to the `webhook-signature` header. If they match, the webhook is authentic.

<Info>
  We follow the Standard Webhooks specification. You can use their libraries to verify signatures: [https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks/tree/main/libraries). For event payload formats, see the [Webhook Payload](/developer-resources/webhooks/intents/payment).
</Info>

### Responding to Webhooks

* Your webhook handler must return a `2xx status code` to acknowledge receipt of the event.
* Any other response will be treated as a failure, and the webhook will be retried.

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Use HTTPS endpoints only" icon="lock">
  Always use HTTPS URLs for webhook endpoints. HTTP endpoints are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and expose your webhook data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Respond immediately" icon="bolt">
  Return a `200` status code immediately upon receiving the webhook. Process the event asynchronously to avoid timeouts.
  
  ```javascript
  app.post('/webhook', async (req, res) => {
    // Acknowledge receipt immediately
    res.status(200).json({ received: true });
    
    // Process asynchronously
    processWebhookAsync(req.body).catch(console.error);
  });
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Handle duplicate events" icon="rotate">
  Implement idempotency using the `webhook-id` header to safely process the same event multiple times without side effects.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Secure your webhook secret" icon="key">
  Store your webhook secret securely using environment variables or a secrets manager. Never commit secrets to version control.
</Accordion>

### Implementation Example

Here's a complete Express.js implementation showing webhook verification and handling:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Express.js Webhook Handler
import { Webhook } from "standardwebhooks";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const webhook = new Webhook(process.env.DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET);

app.post('/webhook/dodo-payments', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Extract webhook headers
    const webhookHeaders = {
      "webhook-id": req.headers["webhook-id"] as string,
      "webhook-signature": req.headers["webhook-signature"] as string,
      "webhook-timestamp": req.headers["webhook-timestamp"] as string,
    };

    // Verify the webhook signature
    const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
    await webhook.verify(payload, webhookHeaders);
    
    // Acknowledge receipt immediately
    res.status(200).json({ received: true });
    
    // Process webhook asynchronously
    processWebhookAsync(req.body).catch(console.error);
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook verification failed:', error);
    res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }
});

async function processWebhookAsync(data: any) {
  // Handle the webhook event based on type
  switch (data.type) {
    case 'payment.succeeded':
      await handlePaymentSucceeded(data);
      break;
    case 'subscription.created':
      await handleSubscriptionCreated(data);
      break;
    // Add more event handlers...
  }
}
```

```javascript Testing Webhooks Locally
const { Webhook } = require("standardwebhooks");
const axios = require("axios");
const crypto = require("crypto");

// Generate test webhook
const timestamp = new Date();
const webhookId = crypto.randomUUID();
const payload = {
  business_id: "biz_test123",
  type: "payment.succeeded",
  timestamp: timestamp.toISOString(),
  data: {
    payload_type: "Payment",
    payment_id: "pay_test456",
    amount: 2999
  }
};

// Sign the payload
const webhookSecret = process.env.DODO_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
const webhookInstance = new Webhook(webhookSecret);
const payloadString = JSON.stringify(payload);
const signature = webhookInstance.sign(webhookId, timestamp, payloadString);

// Send test webhook
const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/webhook/dodo-payments', payload, {
  headers: {
    "webhook-id": webhookId,
    "webhook-timestamp": Math.floor(timestamp.getTime() / 1000),
    "webhook-signature": signature,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
});

console.log("Test webhook sent successfully:", response.data);
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Test your webhook handler thoroughly using the dashboard testing interface before processing production events. This helps identify and fix issues early.
</Tip>


## Advanced Settings

The Advanced Settings tab provides additional configuration options for fine-tuning your webhook endpoint behavior.

### Rate Limiting (Throttling)

Control the rate at which webhook events are delivered to your endpoint to prevent overwhelming your system.


<Steps>
<Step title="Access Rate Limit Settings">
    In the **Advanced** tab, locate the "Rate Limit (throttling)" section.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Rate Limit">
    Click the **Edit** button to modify the rate limit settings.
    
    <Info>
    By default, webhooks have "No rate limit" applied, meaning events are delivered as soon as they occur.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Set Limits">
    Configure your desired rate limit to control webhook delivery frequency and prevent system overload.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use rate limiting when your webhook handler needs time to process events or when you want to batch multiple events together.
</Tip>

### Custom Headers

Add custom HTTP headers to all webhook requests sent to your endpoint. This is useful for authentication, routing, or adding metadata to your webhook requests.

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Custom Header">
    In the "Custom Headers" section, enter a **Key** and **Value** for your custom header.
</Step>

<Step title="Add Multiple Headers">
    Click the **+** button to add additional custom headers as needed.
</Step>

<Step title="Save Configuration">
    Your custom headers will be included in all webhook requests to this endpoint.
</Step>
</Steps>


### Transformations

Transformations allow you to modify a webhook's payload and redirect it to a different URL. This powerful feature enables you to:

- Modify the payload structure before processing
- Route webhooks to different endpoints based on content
- Add or remove fields from the payload
- Transform data formats

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Transformations">
    Toggle the **Enabled** switch to activate the transformation feature.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Transformation">
    Click **Edit transformation** to define your transformation rules.
    
    <Info>
    You can use JavaScript to transform the webhook payload and specify a different target URL.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Test Transformation">
    Use the testing interface to verify your transformation works correctly before going live.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Transformations can significantly impact webhook delivery performance. Test thoroughly and keep transformation logic simple and efficient.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Transformations are particularly useful for:
- Converting between different data formats
- Filtering events based on specific criteria
- Adding computed fields to the payload
- Routing events to different microservices
</Tip>
