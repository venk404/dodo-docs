## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 20.9+** (required for Next.js 16)
- **Dodo Payments account** (to access API and Webhook Keys from dashboard)

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodopayments/dodo-nextjs-minimal-boilerplate.git
cd dodo-nextjs-minimal-boilerplate
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Get API Credentials">
Sign up at [Dodo Payments](https://dodopayments.com/) and get your credentials from the dashboard:

- **API Key:** [Dashboard → Developer → API Keys](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/api-keys)
- **Webhook Key:** [Dashboard → Developer → Webhooks](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/webhooks)

<Tip>
Make sure you're in **Test Mode** while developing!
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values with your Dodo Payments credentials:

```env
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY=your_webhook_signing_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_RETURN_URL=http://localhost:3000
DODO_PAYMENTS_ENVIRONMENT=test_mode
```

<Warning>
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Add Your Products">
Update `src/lib/products.ts` with your actual product IDs from Dodo Payments:

```typescript
export const products: Product[] = [
  {
    product_id: "pdt_001", // Replace with your product ID
    name: "Basic Plan",
    description: "Get access to basic features and support",
    price: 9999, // in cents
    features: [
      "Access to basic features",
      "Email support",
      "1 Team member",
      "Basic analytics",
    ],
  },
  // ... add more products
];
```
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Development Server">

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your pricing page!
</Step>
</Steps>

```

## Customization

### Update Product Information

Edit `src/lib/products.ts` to modify:
- Product IDs (from your Dodo dashboard)
- Pricing
- Features
- Descriptions

### Pre-fill Customer Data

In `src/app/components/ProductCard.tsx`, replace the hardcoded values with your actual user data:

```typescript
customer: {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
},
```

### Update Customer Portal

In `src/app/components/Header.tsx`, replace the hardcoded customer ID:

```typescript
const CUSTOMER_ID = "cus_001"; // Replace with actual customer ID
```

You can complete a test purchase to get the customer ID for testing.

## Webhook Events

The boilerplate demonstrates handling two webhook events in `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`:

- `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
- `onPaymentSucceeded` - Triggered when a payment is successful

Add your business logic inside these handlers:

```typescript
onSubscriptionActive: async (payload) => {
  // Grant access to your product
  // Update user database
  // Send welcome email
},
```

Add more webhook events as needed.

For local development, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel to your local server and use it as your webhook URL.

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/dodopayments/dodo-nextjs-minimal-boilerplate)

Don't forget to add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard!

### Update Webhook URL

After deploying, update your webhook URL in the [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/webhooks):

```
https://example.com/api/webhook
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Module not found or build errors">
Delete `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Checkout redirect fails">
**Common causes:**
- Invalid product ID - verify it exists in your Dodo dashboard
- Wrong API key or environment setting in `.env`
- Check browser console and terminal for errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhooks not receiving events">
For local testing, use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose your server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Update the webhook URL in your [Dodo dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com/developer/webhooks) to the ngrok URL. Remember to update your .env file with the correct webhook verification key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Customer portal link doesn't work">
Replace the hardcoded `CUSTOMER_ID` in `src/app/components/Header.tsx` with an actual customer ID from your Dodo dashboard.

Or integrate your authentication system and database to fetch the customer ID dynamically.
