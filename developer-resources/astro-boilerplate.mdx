## Overview

The Astro minimal boilerplate provides a ready-to-use starting point for integrating Dodo Payments with your Astro application. This template includes authentication, webhook handling, and basic payment setup to help you start accepting payments quickly.

<Info>
This boilerplate uses Astro with TypeScript and includes example implementations for checkout sessions and webhook verification.
</Info>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone the Repository">
Clone the boilerplate repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodopayments/dodo-astro-minimal-boilerplate.git
cd dodo-astro-minimal-boilerplate
```
</Step>

<Step title="Get Your API Credentials">
Obtain your credentials from the Dodo Payments dashboard in Test Mode:

- **API Key**: Navigate to **Developer → API Keys** in your [dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com)
- **Webhook Signing Key**: Navigate to **Developer → Webhooks** in your [dashboard](https://app.dodopayments.com)

<Tip>
Start with Test Mode to safely test your integration without processing real payments.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your Dodo Payments credentials:

```bash .env
DODO_API_KEY_TEST=your_test_api_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY=your_webhook_signing_key_here
```

<Warning>
Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Webhook Localhost">
When testing webhooks locally, expose your localhost using tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com):

```bash
ngrok http 4321
```

Add the ngrok URL to the `allowed_hosts` list in `astro.config.mjs` for webhook delivery:

```javascript astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: true,
    allowedHosts: ['your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io']
  }
});
```

<Note>
This step is required for webhooks to be delivered to your local development environment.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">
Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```
</Step>

<Step title="Run the Development Server">
Start the Astro development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.
